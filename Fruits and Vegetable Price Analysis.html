<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Considering the composition of foods within an average meal, how much does price constitute your decisions when it comes to choosing what you’ll next be creating a meal with, or snacking on throughout the day? The FDA has conducted research on this particular subject, comparing the prices of healthy and unhealthy (less healthy) foodstuffs <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>; considering whether price is a barrier towards healthier eating.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In creating this research, and aiming to understand the average price of produce, the FDA has so far managed four years of average price per units for fruits and vegetables <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, alongside Cup Equivalent Price (CEP, or the price of a cup made of the edible weight of a produce item). This appeared to be a fun set of data to analyze, so I have performed a brief overview on what is being said about the 2022 year (most recent) report on Fruit and Vegetable Prices.</p>

<p>All year files provided by the FDA on the post have been extracted and joined into a large data frame, for the sake of practice and condensation (involving the conversion of excel sheets into digestible tibbles, as well as condensing the labels of diverse fruits and veggies to access readily through dplyr). New columns for identification of year and distinguishing forms and types were created; below is the entirety of the data if such would be the desire to quickly survey it.</p>

<p>Clearly, there are more vegetables than fruits to account for (at the very least those under the designation of “Fresh”, as opposed to “canned”, “dried”, or “juice”). Still, we can see the vast majority of our vegetables are in the bucket which hovers around $0.50 per cup equivalent price. Conversely, most of our fresh fruits are around $0.75 or $1.00.</p>

<p>Among fruits, most berries seem to be quite luxurious items, at least considering how much one would have to pay on average to acquire an edible cup of, say, raspberries. Vegetables have artichokes, asparagus, and okra beyond the $2 per edible cup, while the fourth (boiled spinach) is a rough 59 cents less than okra in third standing.</p>
<p>These are some hearty fruits and vegetables, of considerable good taste, among these— though they might serve to bring meal costs up in comparison to cheaper items.</p>

<p>The most trusted, widely recognized fruits and vegetables, are still within the accessibility of pricing— watermelons with its tasty, watery composition are on average quite the deal to buy for a longstanding refreshing time.</p>
<p>Potatoes and carrots are alongside each other in the top for vegetables; nunsurprisingly considering the wide appeal and application of them, and their status as the status quo for vegetables, as well as almost the entirety of the crop being edible in its own respect.</p>

<p>Interesting and implicit within this collection of data, is the government’s department consideration for how much of a fruit or vegetable remains if you consider only the edible weight, represented within the frames as the “Yield” (or the ratio of weight of a produce item after the inedible parts are removed to the total weight). What is being used here is Handbook 102 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In the figure below, we can see the distribution of the yields for fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>A good deal of fruits are around ~90% edible, though a good number of commonly purchased fruits appear to yield less edible weight than this (almost half of them). Vegetables are more numerous around the 80% mark, and interestingly, yield even further than 100% for some; upon doing research and contacting the people maintaining the dataset, this is under the consideration that some vegetables (in this case kale, collard greens, and brussels sprouts), gain weight when cooked or are processed in such a way that they can be consumed.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fruits and vegetables are an important aspect of the ecosystem, and also of our human existence, as it relates to our meal choices and also health. It’s interesting to consider, then, how much it’d cost on average to have a well-balanced meal, and also how much food are you getting for that money.</p>
<p>Personally, this was insightful enough to make me see that fruits and vegetables are fairly accessible, though some are definitely bound to make my grocery budget max out within a few purchases, so I have been mindful of, say, my strawberry purchases and opting for other fruits like oranges in this winter season.</p>
